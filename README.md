# Pewlett Hackard Analysis using SQL

## Overview of Pewlett Hackard Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Bobby in creating a report that would enable his managers at Pewlett Hackard prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.  To complete this project we used SQL to help sort through employee information to determine the number of employees that may soon be ritiring based on their age and organized them by title.  We also generated a list of employees that could potentially shift into a mentorship role as they near retirement in order to help younger employees take over the positions they will be retiring from.
